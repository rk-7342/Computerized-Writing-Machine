# Computerized-Writing-Machine
A writing machine using Arduino Pro Mini is a great project that involves mechanical, electronic, and programming aspects. It typically uses servo motors or stepper motors to move a pen across a surface to write text or draw images.

Components Required:
Arduino Pro Mini – The brain of the system
Stepper Motors (e.g., NEMA 17) + Drivers (e.g., A4988) – For precise movement of the pen
Servo Motor (SG90/MG995) – To lift and drop the pen
Belts and Pulleys (GT2 timing belt & pulleys) – For smooth movement
Linear Rails or Smooth Rods + Bearings – For stable axis motion
H-Bridge or Motor Driver Board – If using DC motors
Power Supply (12V for stepper motors, 5V for Arduino & servos)
Frame (3D printed, Aluminum, or Wood) – To mount the components
Limit Switches (optional) – For homing calibration
Pen or Marker Holder – Can be 3D printed
Working Principle:
The X-axis moves the pen left and right.
The Y-axis moves the pen up and down.
A servo motor lifts and places the pen on the surface.
The Arduino processes G-code (or pre-defined instructions) to move the motors accordingly.
Software Required:
Arduino IDE – For writing and uploading code
GRBL Firmware (optional) – If using stepper motors
Processing / Python (optional) – For generating text and drawings
Inkscape + Gcode Extension – If converting images or text into machine instructions
Basic Steps to Build It:
Assemble the Mechanical Frame (X-Y movement system)
Connect Stepper Motors to Motor Drivers
Wire Servo Motor for Pen Up/Down Movement
Upload the Control Code to Arduino
Test Basic Movements (X & Y-axis, Pen Up/Down)
Load a Drawing or Text & Execute G-code
